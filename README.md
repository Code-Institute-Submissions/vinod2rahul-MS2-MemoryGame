Milestone project-2: User- Interactive Front-end - Code Institute.<br><br>
This is a simple Memory Game, where the player can click on cards to match the colours.<br><br>
As the cards don’t match, it’s not a pair, so It turns them back over. The two cards match it’s a pair! It keeps the cards and can play again.<br><br>
The player can reset the game at any point of time- It's a single-player game. Language version English.<br><br>

#   UX

##  Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible, So that player can quickly start the game.
	## Scope
The Colours should be dynamic, So the player doesn't have the chance to remember the colours.
## Structure
I wanted the player to be able to quickly understand "How to play".
